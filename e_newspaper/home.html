                    Newspaper Carrier (Former Employee) –  Brampton, ON </p>
                <p>
                    For the short time I spent with this company, most of my experiences were delightful, and I believe
                    that thus is an excellent job to pick up, only if you have time, and a reliable means of transport as
                    papers are heavy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This company is ok. This is the first job I had and the experience was alright. I worked here for
                    about one year as a newspaper carrier. The benefits are you work minimal hours depending on the number
                    of houses you deliver to. The only requirement is papers are delivered on Thursdays before 7 pm.
                    The downsides are the wage is far below minimum wage when you calculate the hours you work compared
                    to the salary. I made something like 7 cents per paper plus commission for each ad in the paper.
                    The amount all depends on the type of ad. I delivered to about 100 houses, give or take. To fold and
                    deliver all those papers, it took around four to five hours and I usually made around $30 bi-weekly.
                    In my opinion the wage is way too low, but not bad for a first job.
                </p>

                    <span>Adequate organisation and correspondence</span>
                    Newspaper Carrier (Former Employee) –  Toronto, ON</p>
                <p>
                    Very relaxed and casual correspondence with supervisor over email.
                    Resource deliveries were always on time.
                    Long route, hard work, and low pay. Good learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would come home from school every Wednesday and Thursday and put the news papers together and make
                    sure they were delivered by 6:00pm and would get paid every three weeks by the customers that actually did pay.
